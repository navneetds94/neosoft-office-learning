1.) Cell Refrences
=> All rectangular boxes in excell knows as cell

. => Every cell has its own address, the cell address is use to where to look value
. => In starting alphabet is column and number is row 

Ex.
A10 -> it's meaning is that this cells belongs to A Th column and 10 row
A10,A20 -> cell A10 and cell A20
A10:A20 -> the range of cell from column A's 10 row to column A's 20 row
B15:E15 -> the range of cell from column B's 15 row to column E's 15 row


we can also use cell reference in other cell by using this

=A10

Cell Refrence are two type :-
1.) Relative Reference -> if i gave some number in A10 = 20 then want to use this value in other cell of A10 suppose in B16

then i can add just refrence address of A10 in B16 then A10 value is shown

this value will change if i change value in A10 suppose i give A10  10 30 then B16 value is also change according to A10

2.) Absolute Reference

we can use this for some operation that based on some fixed column value

for example : discount percent , add some string after category , et

$ => is use for this

we can use Alt + F4 to use fixed column 


Excel Example

Discount	5	$$

SNO	Product	Price	        Discount     Value	  New Price	After Event     Sting		
1	Noodles	                100	       20	  80	        180		$$-Noodles
2	Vada Pav	        15	       3	  12	        27		$$-Vada Pav
3	Dosa	                80	       16	  64	        144		$$-Dosa
4	Chole Bhature	        160	       32	  128	        288		$$-Chole Bhature
5	Grilled Sandvich        120	       24	  96	        216		$$-Grilled Sandvich
6	Halwa	                13	       2.6	  10.4	        23.4		$$-Halwa

Basic Formulas in Excel:-
A formula is a mathematical expression that operates on values in a set of cells.
Even if the result is an error, these formulas return a result. Excel formulas allow you to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division calculations.
In addition to these, you can use Excel to find averages and percentages for a range of cells, manipulate date and time values, and much more.


Functions are used to perform complex calculations that are difficult to achieve manually.

by selecting val one by one	450      // => =A2+A3+A4+A5+A6+A7+A8+A9+A10 => this is a formula
By sum formula	450                      // => =SUM(A2:A10)


1.) SUM function
Syntax => =SUM(Number1, Number2..)
SUM
The SUM() function, as the name suggests, gives the total of the selected range of cell values. It performs the mathematical operation which is addition. Here’s an example of it below:
Sum with Range (Start Cell : End Cell)
Sum with Shortcut – Alt + =
Sum of a Range with Texts in some cells

Running Total calculation excel 
=SUM($A$2:A2)

Numbers	Running Total
10	10
20	30
30	60
40	100
50	150
60	210
70	280
80	360
90	450

=SUM(C10:C19)/COUNT(C10:C19)

4.) Count
Syntax -> =COUNT(Number1,Number2…)
The function COUNT() counts the total number of cells in a range that contains a number. It does not include the cell, which is blank, and the ones that hold data in any other format apart from numeric.

Various Usage of Count functions are –
Count with Numbers -> use count for that only counts that have number value not for categorical
CountA -> use count for the numbers and category excluding blank data
CountBlank -> this will return count of blank values.

			110	                110
----  
14 => =SUMPRODUCT(K27:K30)

Manual Way 
2*6 =>12
3*7 =>21
4*8 =>32
5*9 =>45

12+21+32+45 = 110

By Formulla
=SUMPRODUCT(K27:K30,L27:L30) = 110

if we give only single array then it will just do normal plus


example 3

num1	num2	num3	Manual Sum Product	By Formula
1	10	100	1000	
2	20	200	8000	
3	30	300	27000	
4	40	400	64000
                        ------------------	-------------------
			100000	                100000

explaination is same just given n number of arrays will treat same


example 4

  num1	  num2
| 1	| 10
| 2	|
| 3	| 30
| 4	| 40
| 5	  60
	
	
	#VALUE!

=RIGHT(text,[num_chars])
=MID(text, start_num, num_chars)

These functions is use for slicing of the string

The LEFT() function returns the number of characters left from the beginning of a text string till number of character choosed.
The LEFT() function returns the number of characters right from the end of a text string till number of character choosed.
The mid function returns the number of characters from mid means start from then and position to end char string example if  give 2 , 3 it means start from 2 and give 3 char after that


LEFT RIGHT MID			
TEXT	LEFT	RIGHT	MID
SACHIN	SAC	HIN	ACH

=LEFT(B135,3)
=RIGHT(B135,3)
=MID(B135,2,3)

19.) UPPER, LOWER, PROPER
Syntax
=UPPER(text)
=LOWER(text)
=PROPER(text)

the UPPER () function, any text string can be converted to uppercase using the UPPER() function

The LOWER() function, on the other hand, converts any text string to lowercase. 

The PROPER() function converts any text string to proper case, which means that the first letter in each word is in uppercase and the rest are in lowercase.

			
TEXT			UPPER			LOWER			PROPER
SACHIN tendulkar	SACHIN TENDULKAR	sachin tendulkar	Sachin Tendulkar

=UPPER(B142)  => SACHIN TENDULKAR
=LOWER(B142)  => sachin tendulkar
=PROPER(B142) => Sachin Tendulkar


20.) NOW()
The NOW() function in Excel gives the current system date and time.

=NOW() // 01-04-23 0:34


21.) TODAY()
The TODAY() function in Excel provides the current system date.
=TODAY() // 01-04-23


22.) DAY()
The function DAY() is used to return the day of the month. It will be a number between 1 to 31. 1 is the first day of the month, 31 is the last day of the month.
=DAY("01-04-23") // 1

23.) MONTH()
The MONTH() function returns the month, a number from 1 to 12, where 1 is January and 12 is
December.
=MONTH("01-04-23") // 4

24.) YEAR()
The YEAR() function, as the name suggests, returns the year from a date value
=YEAR("01-04-23") // 2023

25.) TIME()
The TIME() function converts numbers representing hours, minutes, and seconds to an Excel serial number formatted with a time format.
=TIME(10,15,44) // 10:15 AM

26.) HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND

The HOUR() function returns the hour as a number ranging from 0 to 23 from a time value. In this context, 0 denotes 12 a.m. and 23 denotes 11 p.m.
MINUTE() returns the minute from a time value as a number ranging from 0 to 59.
The SECOND() function returns the second as a number ranging from 0 to 59 from a time value.


Hour	10 // =HOUR(E11)
Minute	15 // =MINUTE(E11)
Seconds	44 // =SECOND(E11)



## CONDITIONAL FORMATTING
Use conditional formatting to explore and analyse data visually, detect critical issues, and identify patterns and trends.
Conditional formatting allows you to easily highlight interesting cells or ranges of cells, highlight unusual values, and visualise data
by using data bars, colour scales, and icon sets that correspond to specific variations in the data.

The appearance of cells in a conditional format is determined by the conditions you specify. If the conditions are met, the cell
range is formatted; otherwise, the cell range is not formatted. There are many pre-existing conditions, and you can also add your
own (including by using a formula that evaluates to True or False).

##   Consolidate
Consolidation is transferring data from multiple worksheets or locations to a single site. You
can merge data from each sheet into a master worksheet to summarize and report individual
worksheets' results. The sheets can be in the same workbook as the master worksheet or in
other workbooks. When you consolidate data, you gather it to update and aggregate it as
needed simply.

Consolidation can be performed in 3 ways depending upon the need 
Static All Same
Linked All Same

We can do this by just

use function then click on cell after that press shift and click on workbook there you want to last consilidate after that click enter

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

consolidate in data option also we can consolidate steps given below

Step 1 -> Go to Data Ribbon
Step 2 -> In that click on Consolidate 
Step 3 -> Popup come 

in 1st option gives the function to use
Reference is choosing sheets to consolidat

step 4 click on reference redish button for choose in same workbook to search

click on sheet name you want to consolidate

select the cell drag till you want to select and then hit enter

click on add button 

and repeat the sheet step untill you want to stop


These value is not change if we change number in real cell but with 1st method data will change

## VLOOKUP

The VLOOKUP
(Vertical Lookup) function looks for a value in the table's leftmost column and returns a value from another column you specify in the same row.

When you need to find something in a table or a range by row, use VLOOKUP. For
example, you may check for the pricing of an automobile part by its part number, or
you can find an employee's name by their employee ID

vlookup(lookup value, table array, col index num, [range lookup]) is the syntax.


=VLOOKUP (What you want to
look up, where you want to look for it, the column number in the range containing
the value to return, return an Approximate or Exact match – represented as 1/TRUE,
or 0/FALSE).

# Finding Camera Price
=ROUND(VLOOKUP(H2,A2:E9,4,FALSE),2)
=ROUND(VLOOKUP("Camera",A2:E9,4,FALSE),2)

# Finding Camera Quantity
=VLOOKUP(H2,A2:E9,3,FALSE)
=VLOOKUP("Camera",A2:E9,3,FALSE)


######## VLOOKUP with Trim Function

In general, the VLOOKUP function can lookup a value and return the matched value. However, if there
are extra spaces in cells, such as leading or trailing spaces, the formula will return an error value #N/A
even if a value is matched, as shown in the screenshot below. This guide includes some tips for doing
this task.
In this scenario, you can use the VLOOKUP and TRIM functions together to look up a value while
ignoring unnecessary spaces.

Syntax: vlookup(lookup_value, TRIM(table_array), col_index_num, [range_lookup])

after applying formulla you just need to do shift+ctrl+enter in formulla bar


##### VLOOKUP with DATA VALIDATION

Data validation in Excel is a function that allows you to control the type of data that is entered into your worksheet. Excel data
validation, for example, will enable you to limit data entries to a dropdown list selection and restrict specific data entries, such as
dates or numbers, outside of a predetermined range.
Sometimes to give more control in the Sheet or a Report, we use Data Validation or dropdown with Vlookup.

Adding Dropdown of selection value by these step
Step 1 => go in data ribbon
click data validation
click on drop arrow and choose data validation
click settings
then under allow choose list
then in formula click extract box
drag values from wanted column
then enter


#### Match
MATCH is an Excel function used to find the location of a lookup value in a row, column, or table. MATCH allows for approximate
and accurate matching and wildcards (*?) for partial matches. MATCH is frequently used in conjunction with the INDEX function to
obtain a value at a matched place.


#### Match with Index
INDEX function with MATCH - INDEX is a function that returns a value corresponding to the row number entered in SYNTAX
=INDEX (array, row_num, [col_num], [area_num]) 

=INDEX(A41:A48,I42,1)



#### HLOOKUP

The HLOOKUP function in Microsoft Excel conducts a horizontal lookup by searching for a value in the
table's top row and returning the value in the same column depending on the index number.
The HLOOKUP function is an Excel built-in function classified as a Lookup/Reference Function. It can be
used in Excel as a worksheet function (WS). The HLOOKUP function is a worksheet function that can be
used as part of a formula in a worksheet cell.
Syntax
SYNTAX: HLOOKUP( value, table, index_number, [approximate_match] )
Parameters or Arguments
Value - The value to search for in the first row of the table.
Table - Two or more rows of data sorted in ascending order.
index_number - The row number in the table from which the matching value must be returned. The first
row is 1.
approximate_match - Optional. To locate an exact match, enter FALSE. Enter TRUE to discover a close
match. If this parameter is omitted, TRUE is the default.

######################## Logical Operators in Excel
 Logical operator (sometimes called as Boolean Operators) are used in Excel to compare Two Values.
In Excel, logical operators are widely used with conditional statements, mathematical formulas etc. Below is the list of logical
operators widely used in Excel

Eqal To		=	=A1=B1 => This formula return TRUE if A1 is equla to B1 ; otherwise FALSE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not Equal To	<>	=A1<>B1 => This formula return TRUE if A1 is not equla to B1 ; otherwise FALSE // opposite of equal to operator
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greater Than	>	=A1>B1 => This formula return TRUE if A1 is greater than B1 ; otherwise FALSE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greater Than
To		>=	=A1>=B1 => This formula return TRUE if A1 is greater than or equal to B1 ; otherwise FALSE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Less Than	>	=A1<B1 => This formula return TRUE if A1 is lesser than B1 ; otherwise FALSE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greater Than
To		>=	=A1<=B1 => This formula return TRUE if A1 is lesser than or equal to B1 ; otherwise FALSE

##################### Logical Functions in Excel
In spreadsheets, logical functions determine whether a scenario is true or untrue. You can then choose to perform one of two
things based on that test results. These choices can show information, make various calculations, or run more tests.

There are different logical functions.

IF ()
The IF function is the most critical logical function in decision making.
It follows this format: IF/THEN (condition, true, false)
for example
=IF(B2 > 400, "High," "Low")
If B2 is more significant than 400, the text "High" will be displayed (the result of the test is yes or TRUE)
If B2 is less than or equal to 400, the text "Low" will be shown (the result of the test is no or FALSE)

AND()
When comparing multiple conditions, the AND function is utilised. It returns TRUE only if all of the conditions are met.
the following syntax: AND (condition1, condition2,...)
for example, use the following formula:
=AND(B2<400, B2>300)

where B2 < 400 is the initial condition
tested The second criterion being checked is B2 > 300. This will
only get the result TRUE if the value in cell B2 is less than 400 and
larger than 300. In all other cases, the answer will be FALSE. So
basically it will return TRUE for numbers between 300 to 400.


OR()
The OR function can also be used to compare multiple conditions. If any of the conditions are met, it returns TRUE.
the following format: =OR(condition1, condition2,....)
for example,

=OR(B2<400, B2>300) where B2 < 400 is the initial condition tested
The second criterion being checked is B2 > 300. If either the value
in cell B2 is less than 400 or the value in cell B2 is greater than 300,
the result is TRUE. In all other cases, the answer will be FALSE. So
basically, it will return TRUE for all the numbers.


IFERROR()
The IFERROR function is one of the widely used functions in complex formulas in Excel. This function is not used to calculate
anything but rather to Trap an error. Generally, based on IFERROR results, further calculations are drawn.
If a formula evaluates to an error, IFERROR returns the value you specify; otherwise, it returns the formula result. The
simplest example could be divided by 0. Excel throws an error when a number is divided by 0; hence IFERROR, the function can
check the denominator and print the result instead of Error. This function is also widely used with VLOOKUP to check if the
reference value is available or not in the Range
=IFERROR(Value, Value_If_Error)
value : Required. The argument that is checked for an error.
value_if_error : Required. The value to return if the formula evaluates to an error. The following error types are
evaluated: #N/A, #VALUE!, #REF!, #DIV/0!, #NUM!, #NAME?, or #NULL!.


In this example, We have data for Sales employees and their years in Service. If the formula return is divided by 0 error, we can
predict which employee is in its first year of Sales, and thus average salary cannot be drawn.


Sales Employee		Total Sales		Year		Average Annual Sales
Ram			213935			3		71312
Buvan			437834			6		72972
Hari			116450			0		First Year
Geetal			170360			0		First Year	


=IFERROR(B138/C138,"First year")
