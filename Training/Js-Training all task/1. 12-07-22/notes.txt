-> Javascript :- It is an client-side scripting language.
   -> client-side :- execute by the browser 
   -> scripting language :- interpriting language (line line)
   It is a programming language initially designed to interect with elements of web pages(runtime DOM manupaulation).
    --> Javascript consists of 3 parts 
       1. ECMAScript provides the core functionalities.
       2. DOM provides a interface for interecting with elements.
       3. BOM provides the browser API for interecting with the browser.
     -> How Javascript is work on the browser (execute)
     When a web page is loaded , the Javascript engine in the browser executes a Javascript code.The Javascript code then modifies the HTML and CSS to update the UI dynamically.
     *** Modern Javascript browsers are typically implemented as just-in-time (JIT) compilers that compile Javascript code to bytecode for improved performance.

     --> Histroy of Javascript
      1995 -> Mocha 
      Then its name is changed LiveScript 
      -> Netscape change LiveScript to Javascript (1.0)
         -> Javascript in Netscape Navigator 
         -> JScript in IE.
         -> ECMA-263 , a standard for defining a new scripting lanaguage named (ECMAScript)
         -> Old Javascript is known as ES5 
         -> New Featues ECMA 2015 (Es 6)
    -> How we execute Javascript code 
       -> Javascript is case sensitive lanaguage 
       -> extension is .js 
       -> in <script> tag we write the js code 
    -> How we implememt Javascript 
       Internal way :
        home.html 
        <html>
          <head>
             <script>
                js code 
             </script>
         </head>
        </html> 
       External way :
       first.js 
         Javascript code
         home.html 
        <html>
          <head>
             <script src="first.js">
             </script>
         </head>
        </html> 
        --> Comments :- to describe the code 
          single :- // 
          multiple :- /*  */
          html :- <!-- -->
        --> How we render | print data in browser 
          document.write("--");
        --> Console :- used to diplay data in console , debug a data and all erros are shown in the console.
          console.log("--")
*** Everything in Javascript is an object . all the properies are the part of window object 

--> In every browser their is a Javascript engine which execute the Javascript code and give us output 
  -> Chrome :- V8 
  -> Firefox :- Spider Monkey 
  -> Ie | Safari :- chakra
